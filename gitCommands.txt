*********************************************************************************
Before commiting, delete contents of below folder
E:\vscode\AngularProjects\thoughtShare\.angular\cache\15.1.6\angular-webpack
E:\vscode\AngularProjects\thoughtShare\.angular\cache\15.1.6\babel-webpack

Now mentioned "node_modles" inside .gitignore folder to skip this from commiting.

*** Note - ignore *** commented lines.

git init
git status
git .					###Currently executing this, started on 12pm,5th march
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
***Now create repo in github
***copy its url - https://github.com/anandpandey13/thoughtShare.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/anandpandey13/thoughtShare.git

***git lfs install

***git lfs track '*.ts'
***git lfs track '*.json'
***git lfs track '*.js'
***git lfs track '*.exe'

***git lfs push --all origin master

git push -u origin master

***If you wish to pull the repository on another device, simply install git-lfs on that device(per local repository).

***Now when you will make modifications to any files or folders, follow the same procedure in step 4 above to commit your changes.
git status
git add .
*** or we can use git add <fileName1> <fileName2> <fileName3>
git commit -m "changes in the index.html"
git push origin

****************************************************************
Now comes the deployment part, run below commands 
npm install -g @angular/cli@15.1.6		*** If not installed.
ng add angular-cli-ghpages
***ng deploy --base-href=/thoughtShare/		this command didn't work for me. So, I used below command.
ng deploy --base-href=Pages

***It will build and auto publish to github pages for user use.
Go to - https://anandpandey13.github.io/thoughtShare

Finished !

Bottom Line - I didnot commit node_modules due to large size by putting it in .gitinore file
I published pages on git page directly through cli, see the previous section for it.
